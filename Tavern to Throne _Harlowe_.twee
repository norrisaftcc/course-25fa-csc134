:: Castle {"position":"650,25","size":"100,100"}
(display:"HUD")

**Gullspike Castle** rises like a fist of stone. At the gate, two halberds bar your path.

> Guard: "State your business. Be quick, the Regent hates delays."

You weigh your options.

(if: $amber > 0)[
	* [[Present the amber token->Token Check]]
]
* [[Try to slip past when the bell tolls->Sneak]]
* [[Challenge the guards outright->Fight]]


:: Detained {"position":"1150,25","size":"100,100"}
(display:"HUD")

They take your gear and your pride in equal measure. The Regent prefers his victories tidy.

> "A would-be hero without the measure to match."

(goto: "Game Over")


:: Fight {"position":"1025,25","size":"100,100"}
(display:"HUD")

You square your shoulders. Steel sings.

You’re brave—but two halberds are still two halberds.

(else:)[
	Bloodied but breathing, you stagger into a side entry as the alarm spreads.

	(goto: "Throne")
]


:: Forest {"position":"400,25","size":"100,100"}
(display:"HUD")

The **Northwood** breathes cool and green. A fox watches from a stump; a crow pretends not to.  
A moss-eaten mile marker points: **Shrine** (←) and **Castle Road** (→).

You recall the bartender’s hint: “Old places remember old kings.”

* [[Search the old shrine for a sign->Shrine]]
* [[Take the road to the castle gates->Castle]]


:: Game Over {"position":"175,200","size":"100,100"}

:: Shrine {"position":"525,25","size":"100,100"}
(display:"HUD")

You find the **Wayshrine of True Measure** half-swallowed by ivy.  
On the altar rests a thumb-sized **amber token**, warm to the touch.

> Inscription: *“Show the measure of your courage, not the noise of your sword.”*

(set: $amber to 1)

You take the token. A low wind answers, as if the shrine approves.

You time the watch change with the chapel bell.

	You glide along the wall’s shadow and slide through a service door.

]


:: Tavern [start] {"position":"275,25","size":"100,100"}
(display:"HUD")

You come to on a splintered bench in **The Copper Tankard**. Lanternlight trembles.  
The bartender polishes a glass, then fixes you with a weary eye.

> "Trouble in the kingdom. Shadows on the roads, whispers of a false king.  
> You'll help… or you'll finish that ale and go."

*What do you do?*

* [[Help the kingdom->Forest]]
* [[Refuse and leave->Game Over]]

:: Throne {"position":"25,175","size":"100,100"}
(display:"HUD")

The **throne hall** yawns long and cold. The Regent preens on a chair that isn’t his.  
The old banner hangs half-covered by his sigil—and beneath the dust, the same amber glyph glows.

> Regent: "Kneel, swear, and live."

(if: $amber > 0)[
	You lift the token. The glyph on the banner answers—stone remembers truth.

	> A hush falls. The hall leans toward you.

	(goto: "Victory")
]
(else:)[
	Without the true sign, your words scatter like sparrows.

	> Regent: "Guards."

	(goto: "Game Over")
]


:: Token Check {"position":"775,25","size":"100,100"}
(display:"HUD")

You raise the **amber token**. The light in it stirs, and for a breath the world sharpens.

> Old Guard (whispering): "The True Measure… We haven’t seen that since the last rightful line."

The guards exchange a look, then stand aside.

* [[Enter the throne hall->Throne]]


:: Victory {"position":"325,200","size":"100,100"}
(display:"HUD")

🏆 '''VICTORY!''' 🏆

The token’s light threads the old banner. The Regent pales; the guards lower steel.  
In the quiet, the people in the shadows lift their heads.

> "Long live the rightful measure."
